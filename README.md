# 💬 About
SandAPI is an open-source project, purpose-built to accelerate plugin creation and eradicate code redundancy.

***(Soon, the library will undergo enhancements and improvements for the Velocity & Spigot/Paper platforms.)***

# ❓ Warning
At the moment, the library has been developed exclusively for my own plugins. I may consider writing a wiki for it for general use in the future.
